Its sudden reappearance has sent waves of shock and awe throughout the runeterra and beyond. \n\nRumors are swirling that this miraculous event heralds the return of Azir, the last known Emperor of Shurima. Whispers in the streets suggest that Azir, who was thought to be long dead, but while official sources remain silent, the people of Shurima are filled with a mixture of hope, excitement, and uncertainty. \n\nAs the Sun Disc stands proudly against the sky, all eyes are on Shurima, waiting to see what this ancient omen will bring to the contient and its future."
