Meanwhile, the Lunari, driven underground for years, rise under the leadership of Diana, challenging the Solari’s rule in the name of balance. As the Rakkor warriors are torn between faith and survival, the fate of Targon lies in the hands of those who can command the mountain’s power or be consumed by it."
