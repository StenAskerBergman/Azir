 Shuriman_shame: "Shuriman Shame"
 Shuriman_shame_desc: "After decades of proclaiming Shuriman superiority, the once-mighty legacy of our empire has withered to a mere husk of its former self, now perceived as nothing more than a fading myth and a joke throughout Runeterra.\n\nThe notion of Shuriman Shame stems from the Great Fall, a deeply ingrained belief among our people that they are fated to bear the burdens of their ancestral actions. The collapse of the Sun Disc marked the beginning of our downfall; despite the empire's initial resilience, its ultimate demise was an inescapable fate.\n\nAs time passed, our national pride eroded, and the once magnificent grandeur of Shurima became obscured. The stories of Shuriman superiority, nobility, and prowess, once the pride of our nation, have now been lost to history, leaving behind only artifacts, ruins, and a pervasive sense of guilt among the Shuriman populace.\n\nThis profound shame, deeply rooted in our collective consciousness, is all that remains of Shurima in the hearts of our people. The lingering pain of not being able to save our empire, our emperor, or our families continues to haunt us. It's a stark reminder of our descent into a fragmented and lawless state, now rife with slavery and chaos"
