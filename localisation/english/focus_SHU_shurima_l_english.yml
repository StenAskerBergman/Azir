Firstly, it acknowledges the rich cultural heritage and legal wisdom inherent in tribal societies, valuing their unique perspectives on justice and governance. \n\nBy bringing these laws into the formal legal system, it allows for a more inclusive and diverse legal landscape that respects the multiplicity of its citizens' backgrounds.\n\nSecondly, it provides legal clarity and security to members of tribal communities. Formal recognition of their laws ensures that tribal members can rely on their customs and traditions to govern their affairs, particularly in areas such as marriage, property rights, and dispute resolution. \n\nThis integration also facilitates better interaction between national and tribal legal systems, reducing conflicts and misunderstandings.\n"
