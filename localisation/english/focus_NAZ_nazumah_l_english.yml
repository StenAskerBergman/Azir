 NAZ_KSANTE_NAME: "K'sante"
 NAZ_KSANTE_DESC: "The Indomitable Warden of Nazumah /n Ksante was a revered guardian of Nazumah in an ancient era, a steadfast figure who was on the brink of an extraordinary destiny. His determination saw him confront and overcome unimaginable challenges, but now, centuries later, he has emerged as a formidable Ascended being of incredible might. With his city revitalized from the ruins, Ksante strives to reinstate Ixtal to its past splendor."

 # Bro What? NAZ_KSANTE_DESC: "The Indomitable Warden of Ixtal /n Ksante was a revered guardian of Ixtal in an ancient era, a steadfast figure who was on the brink of an extraordinary destiny. His determination saw him confront and overcome unimaginable challenges, but now, centuries later, he has emerged as a formidable Ascended being of incredible might. With his ancient city revitalized from the ruins, Ksante strives to reinstate Ixtal to its past splendor."

 NAZ_990_DESC:"Escaping Ascended wrath, Nazumah's founders carved out a stronghold amidst Shurima, subduing the land's monsters. Their prosperity, drawn from the sale of rare monster hides, faces a new threat: the return of the god-like Ascended. Will their defiance endure?"

 NAZ_990_DESC_SHORT:"Escaping the Darkin's wrath, Nazumah's founders carved out a stronghold amidst Shurima, subduing the land's monsters. Their prosperity, drawn from the sale of rare monster hides, faces a new threat: the return of the god-like Ascended. Will their defiance endure?"

 NAZUMAH_990_DESC_LONG:"In the midst of the Great Darkin War, Nazumah's forebears ventured through the Shuriman sands, fleeing the Ascended's oppression. Their journey led to a rare oasis, teeming with life yet infested with formidable beasts. The settlers waged a fierce battle to claim this vital resource, eventually erecting a community upon its shores. For half a millennium, Nazumah flourished, harnessing the creatures' exotic materials to forge superior weaponry and construct robust defenses. In stark contrast to the wider realm of Shurima, Nazumah staunchly denies Azir's sovereignty and any Ascended's dominion. As they stand at the crossroads of tradition and external pressures, one wonders, what destiny awaits Nazumah in the face of these looming threats?"


 NAZUMAH_990_DESC_ORIGINAL:"During the Great Darkin War, the founders of Nazumah traveled southward through the Shuriman Desert to escape the tyranny of the Ascended. They would eventually find an oasis, the only water source for miles, but it was plagued by monsters who depended on it for survival. After a long and hard fought struggle, they claimed the oasis as their own and built a society around it. /n For the following 500 years, this society would end up thriving on hunting the giant monsters for their rare materials to improve their weapons and infrastructure. /n Unlike the rest of Shurima Crest icon Shurima, Nazumah rejects the rule of Azir Azir and any other ascended who would try to lay claim to their home." rewrite this to 241 and end on a question of their fate, similar to this for example:  "Demacia is a kingdom on the western coast of Valoran and prides itself with its small but elite military. Yet political strife and a potential mage uprising aim to destabilize the great nation. How will Demacia survive these great struggles?"
