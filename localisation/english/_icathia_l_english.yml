 icathia.2.t: "The Remnants of a Void World"
 icathia.2.desc: "Many signs left by the Void are remnants in Icathia. The echoes of the dead still linger in the streets and ruins of our land. Our defiance stood tall but fell short of delivering the justice we needed...\n\nAs Icathia descended into decades of war and chaos, we are now left torn and divided. The Void's influence has split us into those who resist its corruption and those who succumb to it, traditionalists yearning for a past they believe was glorious, and reformists who argue there were no glory days under Azir's brutal oppression. The few days of independence we had were soaked in blood, and now Jax, a traditionalist, blames the Void's devastation on Zilean and the mages. Survivors focus on rebuilding, while opportunists exploit the chaos. Even our beliefs are fractured, with some turning to ancient religions or new cults, and others relying on science and pragmatism.\n\nMeanwhile, the Void itself is not unified. Bel'Veth, the Empress of the Void, seeks to reshape it, clashing with the ancient Watchers who wish to end all things. This internal conflict within the Void adds another layer of complexity to our struggle.\n\nWe have been licking our wounds for too long. It is time to pick up the pieces of our ruined lands and move forward...\n\nThere hasn't been any real pressure to do so until now, but a war rages on our doorstep. It is high time we gather our strength and determine our path forward."
