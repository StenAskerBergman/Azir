### DECISIONS (Video n. X on YouTube "Narzgel". If you need any advice, check the UMC Discord)
# For Decisions I use shortcut "dec"

### SOME NOTES
# Filling "allowed" with TAG (making that decision only available for country you want) will reduce lag

# CATEGORY of the decisions - DEC listed under this will fall to the same slot in the game.
# - You MUST create CATEGORY in: YOURMOD/common/decisions/categories
