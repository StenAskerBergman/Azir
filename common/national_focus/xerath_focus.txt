    # Temporary Truce: 
        # Renekton might form a temporary truce with Noxus or other 
        # forces if it directly serves his purpose of getting closer 
        # to his enemies, but this truce would be fragile and likely 
        # to break once his immediate goals are achieved.

    # Unleash the Fury: 
        # Increase division attack and defense, lower division organization.
    
    # Rampage Across Shurima: 
        # Gain war goals on Shuriman nations, increase division speed and damage.

    # Revenge on Nasus: 
        # Focus on a major battle, leading to an epic showdown with an enemy 
        # nation modeled after Nasus.
