### FOCUSES (See MODDING TUTORIAL video n. 2 "Focuses, Command & Scopes" on YouTube "Narzgel". If you need any advice, check the UMC Discord)
# AFK = reserved space for the TAG of your nation

##### FOCUS TREE
# In this first part you only need to change "id" (to your unique ID of your FOCUS TREE) and "tag = " in the "modifier" part.
focus_tree = {
	# ID of the whole FOCUS TREE
	id = AFK_focus
	
	# If Generic nations (those without focus tree) will try to use this FOCUS TREE
	default = no
	
	# How likely is country to use this FOCUS TREE
	country = {
		factor = 0
		
		# Adding TAG of the country you want (for example GER for Germany) will make that country to use this FOCUS TREE
		modifier = {
			add = 50
			tag = AFK
		}
	}
	
	# CONTINUOUS FOCUS position (X = left / right, Y = up / down)
	continuous_focus_position = { x = 25 y = 680 }
